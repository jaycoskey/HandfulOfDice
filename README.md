# HandfulOfDice
Infer the distribution (number and sides per die) of a collection of dice from a list of sums of its rolls

Suppose someone grabs a handful of D&D dice (i.e., 4-, 6-, 8-, 12-, and 20-sided dice) and rolls them one million times. Then they you the sums, as a list of one million integers. How can you use the distribution of sums to infer how many dice were used, and how many sides each one had? I came up with this question a couple months ago, thinking of it as "the Handful of Dice problem", and finally decided to sit down and work out the details. The question seems simple enough to state that I would have guessed it would appear in some corner of the internet as a challenge question and instructive answer, but I couldn't find it. It seems pretty clear that you should have enough information, right?
